https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/3957
Description of the Issue
Save as shortcut is Ctrl + Alt + S in Notepad++ but in most programs it's Ctrl + Shift + S.

Expected Behavior
Expect Ctrl + Shift + S to trigger save as function.

Actual Behavior
Nothing appears to happen.

Most programs use Ctrl + Shift + S as the shortcut for Save As. Why would Notepad++ use something different? Consistency in user interfaces allows me to pick up new programs more quickly and inconsistency slows me down.
